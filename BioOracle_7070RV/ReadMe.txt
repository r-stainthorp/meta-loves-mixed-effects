Bio-ORACLE
Bio-ORACLE is a set of GIS rasters providing marine environmental information for global-scale applications. It offers an array of geophysical, biotic and climate data at a spatial resolution 5 arcmin (9.2 km) in the ESRI ascii format.
The database is documented in an article that is currently under review: Tyberghein L., Verbruggen H., Pauly K., Troupin C., Mineur F. & De Clerck O. Bio-ORACLE: a global environmental dataset for marine species distribution modeling.
